# Dollo Delta
a fully printed 3D printer in a delta style

# Goals in order of priority

1) Make a 3D printer that can make as many of its own parts as possible

2) Have it so the machine can scale with little to no throwing away of old parts

3) Make it easy to assemble

4) Use no more than a single 1KG spool of plastic to make.

5) Make it as low cost as possible.

6) use parts that are each to find.

7) make it durrable (since it can print its own parts this isnt super high priority)

8) hope people stop asking "what if you could 3D print a 3D printer" because of cource you can and its not that unique of an idea


# Part count and list for small Dollo Delta

9 x rack.scad

12 x extention.scad

6 x corner.scad

72 x bow_tie.scad but extra never hurts

6 x motor_mount.scad

1 x hot_end_mount

3 x gear.scad

Metal parts we hope to get rid of in the future

9 x M3x40  for the motor mounts

3 x M3x10  for the motor mounts

Electronics and other

1 x main controller board (we use RAMBo and also like the idea of printing the pcb and solding the componants your self)

3 x end stop switches   we are trying to come up with a clever way of doing with with printed conductive parts

5 x motors

1 x hotend or whatever tool tip you want really

1 x hobbed thing, gear or bolt

1 x bearing for extruder (might be able to print)

1 x heated bed

1 x glass/aluminum that fits on the bed

4 x springs and screw for leveling your bed.
